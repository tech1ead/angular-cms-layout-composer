## Technical Overview

### Key Components
1. **Component Mapping Service (`component-mapping.service.ts`)**: Maps Contentful content types to Angular components, using Angular's `Injector` to create a context for each component.
2. **Contentful Service (`contentful.service.ts`)**: Manages communication with the Contentful API, retrieves page data, and processes entries to provide necessary content.
3. **Layout Mapping Service (`layout-mapping.service.ts`)**: Maps layout types from Contentful to corresponding Angular components.
4. **Render Component (`render.component.ts`)**: Dynamically renders other components based on type and injector inputs.
5. **Dynamic Component Directive (`dynamic-component.directive.ts`)**: Dynamically creates and renders components using Angular's `ComponentFactoryResolver`.
6. **Generic Component (`generic.component.ts`)**: Serves as a container for rendering page layouts and components based on URL.
7. **App Routing Module (`app-routing.module.ts`)**: Defines application routes, handling both home page and other pages.

### Technical Flow
- A page URL is requested, and `ContentfulService` fetches the corresponding page data.
- `GenericComponent` determines the layout type using `LayoutMappingService`.
- Components are rendered dynamically, with each receiving its data through Angular's `Injector`.

### Example Component - Call to Action
Demonstrates a specific component structure and data reception through Angular's dependency injection.
